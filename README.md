# Arduino-Spectral-Visualizer
Using an MSGEQ7 and a LED strip the spectrum of an incoming signal will be visualized. 

## Project steps:
1. Read data from MSGEQ7
2. Control individual LEDS
3. Make separate .ino files and functions.
4. Relate certain frequency bands to specific LEDS
5. Adjust brightness according to input levels, adapt to loudness of music?
