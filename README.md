# Arduino-Spectral-Visualizer
Using an MSGEQ7 and a LED strip the spectrum of an incoming signal will be visualized. 

## Project steps:
1. Read data from MSGEQ7
2. Control individual LEDS
3. Relate certain frequency bands to specific LEDS
5. Adjust number of LEDS activated to corresponding frequency band
6. Add potentiometer for threshold adjustment.
